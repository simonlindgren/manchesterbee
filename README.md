#### Paper abstract
> At 10.31 pm on 22 May 2017 a bomb detonated in the Manchester Arena after an Ariana Grande concert. It killed 22 concertgoers and injured over 800 more. The worst terror attack in the UK since the 7 July 2005 London bombings, it triggered a massive public response leading to, among other things, improvised memorials, spontaneous vigils, dedicated hashtags, and viral videos. It also sparked the memetic reinvigoration and, subsequently, brandification of one of Manchester‚Äôs civic symbols: the worker bee. 

> This article explores the politics of post-terror togetherness through an analysis of the memetic spread and brand adoption of the worker bee after the 22 May 2017 Manchester bombing. Reconceptualising memes as ‚Äòmore or less digital‚Äô, the article ‚Äòfollows‚Äô the bee across bodies, streets and social media platforms via the computational and interpretive analysis of approximately 53,000 Instagram images. It shows how the initial memeification of the bee carried with it grassroots expressions of togetherness while, at the same time, highlighting the elasticity of the bee‚Äôs meaning. Thereafter the article highlights the bee‚Äôs official brandification created but also obfuscated various political tensions. 

> Beyond empirically explicating the relationship between memes and brands in connection to the politics of post-terror togetherness, the article thus makes two broader contributions. First, in terms of its reconceptualization of memes with regards their ‚Äòmore or less digital‚Äô composition, and second, in demonstrating one hybrid method for ‚Äòfollowing‚Äô memes suited to this conceptualization. Both contributions have broader significance for future studies of memes.

As stated in the article (p. X), "we used a machine learning method image classification, through img2vec (He et al 2018), in order to get an overview of clusters of similar images posted during each interval".
